# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I used Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.


## Instructions
To view the feedreader website download all the files and open index.html in your browser.



## Tests
The tests were written in the feedreader.js file.
The test results appears at the bottom of the index.html page.
